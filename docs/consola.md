# Console

On Windows systems, the console is called the command prompt (CMD) and is the application used on NT-based systems (Windows XP, Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Windows Server) to run MS-DOS commands (16-bit .exe) and others such as scripts in *.bat and*.sys format.

The Windows console is the equivalent of the Linux terminal or the one provided by other operating systems such as macOS. The application runs in text mode and is not as intuitive as a graphical user interface, but it shows its potential when it comes to running repetitive tasks, sometimes where the graphical interface is blocked, to manage certain components or access certain system information that is not available in any other way. We compile all the information that we have been offering you about this important tool.

## Access to the Windows console

Access to the Windows command line is offered in two different modes, user and administrator. The first is limited and the second is more powerful and has access to the entire computer. In addition, Microsoft offers a more advanced variant called PowerShell that is intended for system administrators. There are quite a few ways to access the Windows console:

* The easiest way to access it is to type “command prompt” from the general search box in Windows 7 or 8.1. In Windows 10 we can also use the Cortana assistant both by keyboard and with voice commands.
* Another of the fastest ways is to access it from the command prompt in the run window (Windows + R to open it) and type “cmd”.
* The Windows console can also be launched from the start menu. In Windows 7 go to “All programs – Accessories” and you will see the command prompt application included. In the new Windows 10 you will find it in “All programs – Windows System”.
* If you prefer to use shortcuts to have it available at any time you can create one on the desktop.
* If you use the Windows console frequently you can include a shortcut in the taskbar. It couldn't be more direct.
* We can also access the console from the file explorer since the cmd.exe application is hosted in the path C:\Windows\System32.
* Finally, another very simple method of access from Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 is to use the user menu accessible with the Windows + X key combination or by right-clicking on the start button.
