# Camera

The camera, especially on laptops, is key if we are fans of social networks or if for some reason we need to access meetings through one of the platforms that exist today for this, the camera in Windows can be configured when accessing as video or just photos, as well as adjusting additional variables with the resolution and so on, we will see how to open the camera in Windows 10 from various available methods.

With the camera application we can manage both actions to be able to take photos directly from the tool and check its status and configuration for external applications such as the Skype camera. The camera is useful when we use applications to take photos or when we need to have it in third-party applications to make video calls.

We can open the Camera application from the command prompt by accessing the console and running it there. Press Enter and the camera will open.
